// TODO 
// Based on the content you’ve got, I’d break the page into five core sections (plus a global header/footer), which keeps things simple and scannable:

// Hero
// – Logo, tagline (“With Heart and Hand for Your Greenery”)
// – Prominent “Book Your 10 % Discount” CTA

// About
// – Your two intro paragraphs (“After years of hard work…”, “I may be new…”)

// Services
// – A clean, responsive grid listing all 14 services

// Special Offer
// – Highlight “🎉 10 % Discount* on Your First Booking” with footnote

// Contact
// – Phone, email, address (and/or a simple contact form)
